# CNN-Based Defect Classification (OK vs DEFECT)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify industrial casting product images as **OK** or **DEFECT**.

The objective is to simulate AI-based visual inspection used in manufacturing quality control.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Binary image classification (OK / DEFECT)
- Built using TensorFlow / Keras
- Trained on publicly available casting dataset
- Includes training and inference scripts

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## 📊 Dataset

Dataset used:
**Casting Product Image Dataset (Kaggle)**

Download from Kaggle and extract into:

dataset/casting_data/


The dataset should contain:

train/
ok_front/
def_front/
test/
ok_front/
def_front/


⚠️ Dataset is not included due to size constraints.

## 🚀 Installation

pip install -r requirements.txt 


## ▶️ Train the Model

python train.py

The trained model will be saved to: models/defect_classifier.h5

## 🔎 Run Prediction

Place a test image in the project root as:

sample_test.jpeg

Then run:

python predict.py

Prediction result will be saved to:

outputs/prediction_result.jpg



## 📈 Output

Displays prediction (OK / DEFECT)

Prints confidence score

Saves annotated output image
